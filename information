<h1>Evaluating stakeholder exercise preferences in stroke: A Discrete Choice Experiment</h1>

<h2>What is the study about?</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this study is to assess what stroke survivors and other stakeholders would prefer to have included in a stroke specific exercise program. The result from this survey will be used to design a bespoke exercise program for stroke survivors.
</p>

<h2>Why is this research important?</h2>
<p>
Exercise has been shown to have both physical and psychological benefits to stroke survivors and has recently been incorporated into clinical guidelines. This study will ensure that our designed intervention will not only be clinically effective but also acceptable, accessible, and sustainable.
</p>

<h2>Why have I been approached?</h2>
<p>
You have been identified as a key stakeholder for this project (stroke survivor, carer of a stroke survivor, stroke clinician, fitness instructor) currently living in the United Kingdom.
</p>

<h2>Do I have to take part?</h2>
<p>
No. It’s completely up to you if you want to take part. If you start the survey, you are free to withdraw at any point without giving any reason and without any penalty. 
</p>

<h2>What will I be asked to do if I take part?</h2>
<p>
If you decide you would like to take part, you would be asked to complete a short questionnaire that should take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. The survey has two parts:
</p>
<p>
Questions about you (age, gender, etc). If you do not want to answer a particular question this is an option ‘prefer not to answer’. 
</p>
<p>
You will be required to choose between different exercise programs in eight hypothetical scenarios.
</p>

<h2>Will my data be Identifiable?</h2>
<p>
The information you provide is confidential. Survey responses will be anonymous as you will not be asked for any personally identifiable information, although there is an option to leave contact details if you are happy to be contacted about future research. 
</p>
